  - Added toast notifications in store page for success/error feedback

  - Updated across all pages: store.js, product/[id].js, and wishlist.js
  - Provides immediate visual feedback and encourages checkout completion
- **Cart Quantity Update Fix**: Fixed cart item quantity modification functionality
  - **Root Cause**: Function name mismatch between cart.js and CartContext exports
